Goal: Build a "Serverless" Resume Writing Platform called ResumePro that can be hosted on static shared hosting.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + Vite (TypeScript).

UI Library: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS.

Backend/Auth: Supabase (Use the Supabase JS Client).

PDF Processing: pdfjs-dist (Client-side only).

Project Structure & Features:

1. The Landing Page (The Funnel):

Hero: Strong value prop ("Beat the Bots. Get Hired.").

ATS Scanner Component (Critical):

Allow PDF Drag & Drop.

Action: Parse the PDF text in the browser using pdfjs-dist.

Logic: Calculate a score (0-100) based on the presence of keywords (Experience, Skills, Education) and contact info (Email, Phone).

The Gate: If the score is calculated, blur the result and require an Email Signup to reveal it.

Storage: Save the captured email to the leads table in Supabase.

2. The Checkout (Pricing & Add-ons):

Tiers: Entry ($99), Professional ($199), Executive ($299).

Add-Ons (Toggle Switches):

"Cover Letter Writing" (+$50)

"LinkedIn Profile Optimization" (+$75)

Logic: Update the "Total Price" dynamically as toggles are switched.

Checkout: A "Pay with Stripe" button (Mock the interaction for now: Create an order in Supabase with status 'pending').

3. Client Dashboard (Protected Route):

Requirement: Only accessible if logged in via Supabase Auth.

Tabs:

"My Order": Shows current status (e.g., "Writer is drafting...").

"Uploads": User can upload their current resume and job descriptions here.

"Chat": A real-time chat interface connected to the messages table in Supabase (using Supabase Realtime).

4. Admin Dashboard (For Me):

A view to see all Orders.

Ability to click an order, view the client's files, and reply to their chat messages.

Database Schema (Supabase):

profiles: id, email, role (client/admin).

orders: id, user_id, package_tier, has_cover_letter (bool), has_linkedin (bool), status, total_price.

messages: id, order_id, sender_id, content, created_at.

Deployment Constraint:

This app will be hosted on Hostinger Shared Hosting.

Ensure all routing is handled via react-router-dom.

Do not rely on any Node.js runtime features; everything must work in the browser.
